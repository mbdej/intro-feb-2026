# Foundations of Distributed Application Development And Operations in the Modern Enterprise

Presented by Hypertheory Training, Inc. - Jeff Gonzalez (jeff at hypertheory dot com). February 9 - 20 2026.

## Logistics

- *Class Times* are 9:30 AM - 5:00 PM ET Monday-Friday
    - ~4:30 PM on is one-on-one, or assigned tasks.
- *Lunch Break* is 12:30 - 1:30 ET 

## Communications

- While posting comments, funny gifs, etc. in the Teams chat is encouraged, please try not to ask questions there.
    - The instructor will miss them, he'll feel bad, you'll feel ignored, etc. Unmute! This is not a Youtube Video!
- Likewise, the "raising your hand" thing in Teams is not needed. Just unmute and interrupt me! PLEASE.
- You can send me email both in "the company" and at the address above. *Very* asynchronous.
- If you have something scheduled and you *must* miss a portion of the class, please:
    - Let me know. You don't need to ask permission (though large blocks of time missing might be an issue)
    - Find a buddy, a pal, a friend, or make a new one in class. Ask them to take *simple* bullet-point notes about what was covered while you were gone.
    - I'm happy to go over those things with you after class, or in the morning.

## Setup

The instructor will step you through this, so don't work ahead.

1. Log into your Github account with the default browser in the VM.
2. In a terminal window [[keyboard-shortcuts]] run the following two commands:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

And

```sh
git config --global user.email "Your@Email"
```

## Getting the Instructor Code

Pro Tips:

- If you are in Visual Studio (not VS Code) just close it. Really. Bad things can happen.
- Open an integrated terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``) And inssue the following command:
- Make sure your terminal working directory is "~/class/intro"

Run this command:

```sh
./pull-instructor-code.sh
```

## If None of the above works for you - JUST ASK THE INSTRUCTOR!!!
