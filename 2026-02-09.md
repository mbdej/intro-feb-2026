1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day, look at my notes and identify at least one thing that was not fully clear to me.

2. Every morning after today, we will start by being asked:
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yesterday?
    - What was cool and you want to know more about?

## Notes
- "TFS" - "Team Foundation Server" - a Microsoft tool for source code control
    - It is centralized version control. It is not the best.
- Git is decentralized
- GitHub used to be not Microsoft, now is Microsoft
- Azure DevOps (ADO or AzDO) - also Microsoft
    - "for big companies"
    - GitHub and Azure are pretty much the same thing nowadays
- What do you store in source code control (git)?
    - code that you and your team OWN and change
    - don't store other stuff there
        - libraries you use - explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
        - other teams code
- How can I have all source code AND all the history on every machine?
    - you have the current version you've fetched
    - you have "Deltas" (patches) of all changes
    - usually that isn't too much
