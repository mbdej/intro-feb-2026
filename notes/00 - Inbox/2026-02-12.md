- Developer Testing
    - exceeds normal "software testing" - which is "does it meet the business and technical requirements" - all that, plustesting our implementation, our thinking, finding concepts (duplication), etc.
- Kent Beck's Four Rules of Simple Design
    1. Passes the tests - works
        - "start with the end in mind" - what am i trying to accomplish here
        - write a test that proves the system does not currently have that behavior
        - but that test can't be too big
            - "it rates car insurance"
            - "it does stuff"
            - we need a guard rail to keep us from writing too complex code
                - set a time limit
        - GET THE TEST TO PASS
            - write ugly code if you have to
            - make it better by writing new tests that will REQUIRE you to fix the bad things about your code
        - repeat forever until you are done
    2. expresses intent - understandable
    3. no duplication - you've identified concepts
    4. fewest elements - less is better
- "Code Kata"
    - it isn't about getting it done
    - writing just enough code to get to green
    - when you get the next requirement
        - should not pass
        - be maliciously obedient / quiet quitting
