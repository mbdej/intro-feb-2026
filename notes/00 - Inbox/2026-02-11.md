- ASI model?
    - application
        - HTTP
            - asymmetric encription
            - uses port 80
        - HTTPS
            - require(d/s)
                - getting a certificate from a certificate authority
                - they allow you to encrypt communication and ALSO verified identity
                - you can still do that because it is important
            - uses port 443
    - presentation
    - session
    - transport
        - TCP - "Connection Oriented"
        - UDP - "Connectionless" - notifications
    - network
        - IP
        - Routing - how one computer can send messages to another
    - datalink
    - physical
- ACME - Let's Encrypt, etc - Free, easy, all that stuff
- (I don't remember the build up to this point) install a "dev certificate" that is unique to your machine, and then ask your browser (with your approval) to "trust" that certificate
    - these do not work in any "real" env
- MVC (Model View Controller)
    - great model for stateful applications, but the web is stateless so it's a little weird
    - Model
    - View
    - Controller
        - some code gets the request and it either creates the model or returns a view of that model
- if your code is calling ourside your API project across a network
    - databses, other services, etc
    - you MUST use async/await
- garbage collector
    - non-halting (code does not stop for garbage collector)
    - generational (it's smart)
