### Quiz



Quiz
1 When you compile a .NET project, it produces an _assembly_, which is a combination of metadata about the types produced, and the _IL_ (_intermediate language_) that the .NET Runtime (CLR) executes.
  - JVM:JAVA::CLR:DotNet - Visual Basic .NET - C# - F# (OCAML)
2 The major difference between ".NET Core" and what we now call ".NET Framework" is:
    - Core is cross platform and open source, Framework is windows only 
    - .NET Framework - the non-cross platform version will never* get to version 5. 
3 True or _FALSE_: .NET is commercial software and you must pay a license to Microsoft to develop code using .NET.
4 True or _FALSE_: .NET code must be created using Microsoft Visual Studio, though a free version is available.
5 What is a solution in .NET?
    - A glorified folder, holds projects. Holds configuration things
    - FOREVER the file format for solutions was the same, and it was a *mess*. These were "*.snl" files and they had a ton of confusing stuff in it,
      and would constantly cause merge conflicts that were hard to fix, etc.
    - VERY recently (<6mos ago) they released a new version (*.slnx) that is much better, cleaner.
    - As of .NET 10, that is the "Default" for new projects and solutions.
6 What is the purpose of Aspire? At least as far as we are using it.
    - Distributed Application Development. Helps us run and deploy the different applications we have in one nice place.
    - Supports the 'best practice' of Dev/Prod parity from the 12 factor app - orchestrates containers, all that stuff.
7 What are the three main things we design when designing an HTTP API?
    -1). Resources (endpoints).
    -2). Methods (actions, ie GET POST PUT DELETE)
    -3). Formats/Representations (req/res structures)
8 What is meant by the term "Service" as we are using it in our development?
    -  Code that owns some data and all processes around that data
      - This is pretty much my definition of a "microservice" as well.
9 What is the difference between using the HTTP protocol scheme and the HTTPS protocol scheme?
    - The s, or the encrypted later between server/client communication
    - HTTPS is "Transport Layer Security" - tls -
10 What is a "port" in TCP networking?
    - Port where TCP is listening to incoming requests
    - Each application listening on a particular server that uses TCP must have a unique port.
      - There are "standard" or well-known ports:
        - http is 80
        - https is 443
        - mail (smtp) 25
        - sql server 1433
        - postgres 5432
