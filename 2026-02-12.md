### Coupling and Cohesion

Writing code using the four rules of simple design.

- This section seems to be about testing, and it is. But it also contains the secrets to life, death, the universe, and well, everything! STAY FROSTY!
- After we do this, we'll be in a much better place to understand the code we've written in the API, how we can move it forward, add tests, and move on to other programming languages and platforms (like Angular!)



### Daily Quiz

1. When do we use the async/await pattern (that your instructor hasn't even explained yet) in our C# code?
2. What is Open API? 
3. Why did we use an Http DELETE method in our `student/moments` endpoint when we really didn't "delete" anything?
4. Consider the following code we created yesterday:

```csharp
 public static async Task<IResult> MarkQuestionAnswered(Guid id, IDocumentSession session)
    {
        // ...
    }
```

- How is our API being made "aware" that this is the code it should run when receiving an Http DELETE request to `student/moments/b0f17531-ca09-41dd-8654-d0eb180f6797` (for example)?
- Where are the `id` and `session` variables coming from when this method is executed?
- If the API received a request of `DELETE /student/moments/bird-cage` what would the value of `id` be when this code is executed (uhm, might be a trick question), but explain your answer.
- The database provider we are using here calls it a "session", sometimes it's called a "context", and ASP.NET MVC (our platform for building APIs) calls it a "scope". But they all mean basically the same thing in this context, which is:
